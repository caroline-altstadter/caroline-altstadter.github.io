    <p>I am a senior at the University of Colorado, Boulder, where I am majoring in marketing, minoring in Creative Technology and Design and Information Science, and earning a certificate of global business.
        I am currently looking for a full-time position in the Marketing field with hopes of starting in the Fall. My dream career path would be to work at a start up or an advertising agency for a few years before
        going back to school to get my masters degree in UI/UX Design. After completing the program, I would ideally work in UI/UX design or brand marketing for a CPG company.
