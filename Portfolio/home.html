    <p>I am a senior at the University of Colorado, Boulder, where I am majoring in marketing, minoring in Creative Technology and Design and Information Science, and earning a certificate of global business.
        I am currently looking for a full-time position in the Marketing field with hopes of starting in the Fall. My dream career path would be to work at a start up or an advertising agency for a few years before
        going back to school to get my masters degree in UI/UX Design. After completing the program, I would ideally work in UI/UX design or brand marketing for a CPG company.

        Featured Projects
    </h3>
    <h4>Peloton Rebrand</h4>
    <p>To broaden Peloton's appeal beyond its primary female demographic, we launched a high-energy experiential campaign centered on in-person fitness events in major metropolitan hubs. By moving the experience out of the living room and into a competitive, communal setting, we successfully highlighted the versatility of the Peloton App for strength and HIIT. This strategy effectively re-positioned the brand as a performance-driven community, driving significant growth in male user acquisition</p>

    <h4>Adaptive Jewelry Product Design</h4>
    <p>I am currently working with a team to develop an adaptive jewelry tool designed to restore independence for individuals with mobility challenges or limited fine motor skills. By reimagining traditional fastening mechanisms, the product eliminates the frustration of intricate clasps, allowing users to secure necklaces and bracelets with ease and autonomy. Our goal is to bridge the gap between functional accessibility and personal style.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Packaging Design Project</h4>
    <p>This project involved creating a vibrant, pop-art-inspired packaging suite for a new entry into the competitive energy drink market. By utilizing bold halftone patterns, high-contrast palettes, and iconic comic-style typography, the design cuts through shelf clutter to command immediate visual attention. The final aesthetic successfully bridges the gap between retro nostalgia and modern energy, positioning the product as a lifestyle brand for creative, high-tempo consumers</p>
